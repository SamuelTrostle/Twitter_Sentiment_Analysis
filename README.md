# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
Student Research Project where tweets are analyzed for their sentiment.
Twitter developer keys are removed, so the code won't run properly unless anothers are entered.
The Program is also able to be expanded so that it can map the sentiment of states to an SVG map of the US by colors that \n
indicate different ranges of happiness.
